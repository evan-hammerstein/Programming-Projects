**Programming-Projects**
This is the beginnings of my various programming portfolio! I am certified in C++, Python, and Java, as well as Linux and R coming soon. Whenever I make cool projects, I will add them here.

**tif.py** - this is a python file that I wrote that can read and decode .tif files from the raw byte form and turn them into the RGB values! This was low-level programming practice.

**simulator.py** - this is a python file that takes a list of emitters and receivers within a sound system and super imposes them to create a functional sound system simulator.
